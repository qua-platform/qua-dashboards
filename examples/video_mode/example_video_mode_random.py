Example Script: Video Mode with RandomDataAcquirer (Simulation)

This script demonstrates how to use the VideoModeComponent with a RandomDataAcquirer.
This setup is ideal for simulating and testing video mode dashboards without needing
a live connection to an OPX or other hardware. It allows you to understand the
dashboard's functionality, test UI interactions, and develop custom components
in a controlled environment.

Core Components Used:
- SweepAxis: Defines the parameters for each axis in the 2D scan (name, label,
             units, span, number of points).
- RandomDataAcquirer: A data acquirer that generates random data for the 2D scan,
                      simulating a real data acquisition process.
- VideoModeComponent: The main Dash component that orchestrates the video mode
                      display, taking a data acquirer as input and rendering
                      the live plot and controls.
- build_dashboard: A utility function from qua_dashboards.core to construct
                   a Dash application layout with the provided components.

How to Run:
1. Ensure you have `qua-dashboards` and its dependencies installed.
   (e.g., `pip install qua-dashboards`)
2. Save this script as a Python file (e.g., `run_random_video_mode.py`).
3. Run the script from your terminal: `python run_random_video_mode.py`
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` (or the
   address shown in your terminal).

You should see a dashboard titled "Video Mode Simulation (Random Data)"
displaying a 2D plot that updates with new random data periodically. You will
also have controls to adjust the parameters of the X and Y axes (Span and Points)
and the RandomDataAcquirer (Software Averages, Simulated Acquire Time).
